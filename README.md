# seak_seot_diffusion
Code to implement ecological diffusion model and estimate derived quantities for the sea otter population in Southeast Alaska

These R scripts include data preparation, MCMC algorithm implementation, MCMC algorithm, and PDE simulation to compute derived quantities using an MCMC sample.  Not these were designed to submitted as batch jobs on an HPC system; memory demands exceed the capacity of most workstations.
