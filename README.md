# seak_seot_diffusion
Code to implement ecological diffusion model and estimate derived quantities for the sea otter population in Southeast Alaska

These R scripts include data preparation, MCMC algorithm implementation, MCMC algorithm, and PDE simulation to compute derived quantities using an MCMC sample.  Note these were designed to be submitted as batch jobs to an HPC; memory demands exceed the capacity of most workstations.
